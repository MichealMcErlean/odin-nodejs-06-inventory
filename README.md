# Inventory App
## An Odin Project exercise
### Implemented with Node.js, Express and EJS

This was a very interesting project for me, because it's the first time I've really gone back and heavily refactored after reaching completion of core functionality. I had recognised that the similarity in content of my categories and their required pages lent itself to going all-in on URL parameters and handling all the categories dynamically through one set of views. I dithered over it, though, and only really made up my mind to go back and work it out after completing the site's core functionality. The rewritten code for handling the categories is much cleaner, and much easier to expand on going forward if I revisit this.
